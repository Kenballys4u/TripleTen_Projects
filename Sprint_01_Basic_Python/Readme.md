# Basic Python: Golden Age of Television Analysis

## Project Description

This project explores the entertainment industry, focusing on the "Golden Age" of television which is considered to have started in 1999 with the premiere of The Sopranos. Our primary goal is to analyze a dataset containing records of movies and shows to investigate the relationship between the number of votes a title receives and its IMDb ratings. We specifically concentrate on TV shows, examining the assumption that shows with higher ratings also receive a higher number of votes.

Using Python and various data analysis tools, we delve into a comprehensive dataset to uncover insights about TV shows released during this golden era. This project offers an in-depth look at how popular acclaim (as measured by IMDb votes) correlates with critical success.

## Features and Functionality

- Data Overview: Examination of the dataset to assess quality and structure.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleanup of dataset issues such as inconsistent column names and missing values.
- Data Analysis: Evaluation of the hypothesis that higher-rated shows receive more votes on IMDb.

## Deployment and System Requirements

To run this project locally, you will need:

1. Python 3.13.2 or higher.
2. Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization (optional).

**Follow these steps to set up the project:**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis.

## Roadmap

- Enhance Data Visualization: Implement more sophisticated data visualization techniques to better communicate findings.
- Expand Data Sources: Incorporate additional datasets to enrich the analysis and validate findings across a broader spectrum of shows.
- Automate Data Updates: Develop a system to automatically update the dataset with new releases and ratings.
